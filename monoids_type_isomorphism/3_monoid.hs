-- give three more examples of monoids
-- the carrier sets must be different from the examples and from each other
-- be sure to reason about monoid laws

-- 1. Matrix addition
-- The carrier set is the set of all nxn matrices with integer entries
-- The binary operation is matrix addition
-- The identity element is the nxn zero matrix
-- The associativity law holds because matrix addition is associative
-- The identity law holds because the zero matrix is the identity element
-- The closure law holds because the sum of two nxn matrices is an nxn matrix



-- 2. Matrix multiplication
-- The carrier set is the set of all nxn matrices with integer entries
-- The binary operation is matrix multiplication
-- The identity element is the nxn identity matrix
-- The associativity law holds because matrix multiplication is associative
-- The identity law holds because the identity matrix is the identity element
-- The closure law holds because the product of two nxn matrices is an nxn matrix


-- 3.Set union
-- The carrier set is the set of all sets
-- The binary operation is set union
-- The identity element is the empty set
-- The associativity law holds because set union is associative
-- The identity law holds because the empty set is the identity element
-- The closure law holds because the union of two sets is a set
